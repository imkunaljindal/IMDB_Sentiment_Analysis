# IMDB_Sentiment_Analysis </br>
This is a basic project which makes use of Multi Layer Perceptron Architecture to classify a sentiment as either postive or negative. </br>
The input data was vectorized since Keras already provides the sentiments after pre processing it using 'Bag of Words' pipeline. Vectorization of input data makes the data feedable to our Neural Network.
